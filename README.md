# Discordbot
A bot that hosts beatbattles in a discord server. The bot will handle the whole process from queueing up battlers to posting samples, taking submissions and votes and finally presenting a winner. There are more text files included in the project that I did not upload. This is just for portfolio use.

Join the server where it's running <a href ="discord.gg/HxywTd8">here.</a>
